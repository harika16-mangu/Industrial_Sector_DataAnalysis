# Industrial_sector
Industrial sectors and analysis on chain of various sectors within industrial sectors which are manufacturing sector ,transportation sector and retail sector.

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on performing data analysis on three industries: Manufacturing, Transportation & Warehousing, and Wholesale Trade. The goal is to review trends and growth patterns within these industries and provide insights into various aspects such as job types, workforce growth, and revenue generation. Additionally, the analysis includes income projections, price fluctuations, and geographical wage variations of various sectors in the United States.

**Analysis Objectives**
The main objectives of the analysis are as follows:

**Review Industry Trends**: Analyze historical data to identify trends and growth patterns that have existed within the manufacturing, transportation & warehousing, and wholesale trade industries. This will help understand the past performance and potential future direction of these sectors.

**Forecast Growth**: Utilize gathered data and research to forecast anticipated growth in the selected industries. By analyzing historical patterns, market conditions, and other relevant factors, we aim to provide insights into the potential growth trajectories of these industries.

**Job Analysis**: Conduct an in-depth analysis of job types prevalent in each industry. This will include examining the demand for specific roles, identifying emerging job trends, and understanding the skills required for various positions.

**Workforce Analysis**: Evaluate the growth in the number of workers within the manufacturing, transportation & warehousing, and wholesale trade sectors. This analysis will provide insights into the changing employment landscape within these industries.

**Revenue Analysis**: Explore the revenue generated by the selected industries and analyze factors influencing its fluctuations. This will involve studying market dynamics, pricing trends, and economic factors that impact revenue generation.

**Income Projections**: Provide projections and insights on income levels within the industries. This analysis will consider factors such as job roles, geographical location, and market conditions to forecast potential income ranges.

**Geographical Wage Analysis**: Examine geographical variations in wages across different regions in the United States within the selected industries. This analysis will help understand wage disparities, cost-of-living factors, and potential opportunities for workforce mobility.

**Project Structure**
The project is structured as follows:

Data Collection: Gathering relevant data from reliable sources such as industry reports, government databases, and other reputable resources.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. This step includes handling missing values, formatting inconsistencies, and ensuring data integrity..
Forecasting: Utilizing forecasting methods to predict future growth and trends within the selected industries.
Reporting: Summarizing the findings, insights, and recommendations in a clear and concise manner. This may involve generating visualizations, creating interactive dashboards, or preparing written reports.The two main data visualization tools used for this analysis are Flourish and Data Wrapper.

**Conclusion**
In conclusion, the industrial analysis conducted in this project sheds light on the critical role of manufacturing in driving economic growth and its interconnectedness with transportation, warehousing, and wholesale trade. The forecast of higher unemployment and slower job growth emphasizes the importance of proactive measures to address these challenges. This analysis serves as a valuable resource for policymakers, businesses, and stakeholders in understanding the dynamics of these industries and developing strategies to foster growth, innovation, and job creation in the face of evolving economic conditions.It is evident  that manufacturing sector drives economy growth and Experts forecast higher unemployment , slow job growth in upcoming years.
